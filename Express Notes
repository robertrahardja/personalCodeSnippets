Express has just four major features:

Middleware 
—In contrast to vanilla Node, where your requests flow through only one function, Express has a middleware stack, which is effectively an array of functions.

Routing
—Routing is a lot like middleware, but the functions are called only when you visit a specific URL with a specific HTTP method. For example, you could only run a request handler when the browser visits yourwebsite.com/about.

Extensions to request and response objects
—Express extends the request and response objects with extra methods and properties for developer convenience.

Views 
—Views allow you to dynamically render HTML. This both allows you to change the HTML on the fly and to write the HTML in other languages.




Middleware are request handler functions (an array of functions)

express = require ('express')
var app = express() //returns a request handler function
//This is important: it means that you can pass the result into other functions

// common view engine setupp
//The first line tells that the views are in views folder; 
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
//the next line says the views will use EJS
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
